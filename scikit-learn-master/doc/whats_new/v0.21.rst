Version 0.21.0
==============

**In development**

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- please add class and reason here (see version 0.20 what's new)

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

Support for Python 3.4 and below has been officially dropped.

..
    See version doc/whats_new/v0.20.rst for structure. Entries should be
    prefixed with one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|,
    |Enhancement|, |Fix| or |API|. They should be under a heading for the
    relevant module (or *Multiple Modules* or *Miscellaneous*), and within each
    section should be ordered according to the label ordering above. Entries
    should end with: :issue:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.

:mod:`sklearn.linear_model`
...........................
- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`linear_model.MultiTaskElasticNet` which was breaking
  ``MultiTaskElasticNet`` and ``MultiTaskLasso`` when ``warm_start = True``. :issue:`12360`
  by :user:`Aakanksha Joshi <joaak>`.

:mod:`sklearn.cluster`
......................

- |MajorFeature| A new clustering algorithm: :class:`cluster.OPTICS`: an
  algoritm related to :class:`cluster.DBSCAN`, that has hyperparameters easier
  to set and that scales better, by :user:`Shane <espg>`,
  :user:`Adrin Jalali <adrinjalali>`, and :user:`Erich Schubert <kno10>`.
  
:mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`
............................

- |Efficiency| Make :class:`preprocessing.MultiLabelBinarizer` to cache class mappings instead 
  of calculating it every time on the fly.
  :issue:`12116` by :user:`Ekaterina Krivich <kiote>` and `Joel Nothman`_.

- |Efficiency| :class:`preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures` now supports compressed
  sparse row (CSR) matrices as input for degrees 2 and 3. This is typically much
  faster than the dense case as it scales with matrix density and expansion degree
  (on the order of density^degree), and is much, much faster than the compressed
  sparse column (CSC) case. :issue:`12197` by :user:`Andrew Nystrom <awnystrom>`.

- |Efficiency| |API| Speed improvement in :class:`preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures`,
  in the dense case. Also added a new parameter ``order`` which controls output
  order for further speed performances. :issue:`12251` by `Tom Dupre la Tour`_.


:mod:`sklearn.tree`
...................
- Decision Trees can now be plotted with matplotlib using
  :func:`tree.export.plot_tree` without relying on  the ``dot`` library,
  removing a hard-to-install dependency.
  :issue:`8508` by `Andreas MÃ¼ller`_.

- |Feature| ``get_n_leaves()`` and ``get_depth()`` have been added to
  :class:`tree.BaseDecisionTree` and consequently all estimators based
  on it, including :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`,
  :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`, :class:`tree.ExtraTreeClassifier`,
  and :class:`tree.ExtraTreeRegressor`.
  :issue:`12300` by :user:`Adrin Jalali <adrinjalali>`.


:mod:`sklearn.metrics`
......................

- |Feature| Added the :func:`metrics.max_error` metric and a corresponding
  ``'max_error'`` scorer for single output regression.
  :issue:`12232` by :user:`Krishna Sangeeth <whiletruelearn>`.


:mod:`sklearn.neighbors`
......................

- |API| Methods in :class:`neighbors.NearestNeighbors` :
  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors`,
  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors`,
  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors_graph`,
  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph`
  now raise ``NotFittedError``, rather than AttributeError,
  when called before fit :issue:`12279` by :user:`Krishna Sangeeth
  <whiletruelearn>`.

Multiple modules

Changes to estimator checks
---------------------------

These changes mostly affect library developers.
